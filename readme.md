-------------------

- The included circuit layout is not complete.
It only served as a rough sketch when building actual circuit, so expect missing values and components.
- The giant C3 is actually an inductor (no symbol was available in DIYLC).
- Solder pads indicate where interesting things are happening with wiring to the front panel / switches.
